# CSCR1501 - Programming for Problem Solving Lab

This repository contains all my coursework, notes, code, and flowcharts for the B.Tech CSE First Semester course, **Programming for Problem Solving Lab (CSCR 1501)**, at Sharda University.

## Course Description

This course introduces the fundamentals of problem-solving techniques using algorithms, flowcharts, and the C programming language. It covers basic programming constructs, data types, control structures, arrays, and functions.

## Key Skills Learned

*   **Problem Analysis:** Breaking down complex problems into logical, manageable steps.
*   **Algorithm and Flowchart Design:** Visualizing and planning program logic before coding.
*   **C Programming Fundamentals:** Variables, data types, operators, and expressions.
*   **Control Structures:** `if-else`, `switch-case`, `for`, and `while` loops.
*   **Data Structures:** Working with one-dimensional and multi-dimensional arrays.

## Repository Structure

*   `/Unit-1_Introduction-to-Problem-Solving`: Contains notes, flowcharts, and pseudo-code.
*   `/Unit-2_Introduction-to-C`: Contains code examples for C fundamentals.
*   ... (and so on for other units)
