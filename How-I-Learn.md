## HOW_I_STUDY

This repository documents my personal learning workflow for my CSE coursework.
I keep everything transparent because I want this repo to:

* help juniors understand how to study efficiently
* show my learning journey to future collaborators or clients
* provide evidence of real work, not just polished notes

### **My workflow (simple and consistent)**

#### **1. I first read the official course content**

I try to understand the key ideas from lectures, slides, and recommended readings.

#### **2. I create my notes using AI + course content**

I don’t rewrite the teacher’s material manually because it wastes time and adds no value.
Instead, I ask an AI assistant to:

* restructure the concepts
* simplify explanations
* summarize chapters clearly
* highlight important definitions and formulas

This lets me spend more time understanding rather than copying.

#### **3. I ask AI to generate practice questions**

This includes:

* conceptual questions
* short-answer questions
* coding questions
* error-finding questions

These questions force me to test my understanding.

#### **4. I answer the questions myself — without looking**

These are my **raw, unedited answers**, including mistakes.

#### **5. I ask AI to review my answers**

The AI provides:

* corrections
* explanation of my mistakes
* polished/ideal answers
* extra notes when needed

#### **6. I save *everything* in each unit’s PRACTICE_ANSWERS.md**

In this file you will find:

1. **My real original answer**
2. **AI’s review**
3. **A corrected/polished answer**

This keeps the learning process transparent and honest.

### **Why I do it this way**

* Raw answers show what I actually knew at that moment.
* Mistakes show growth and authenticity.
* Polished answers show my improved understanding.
* Everything stays organized and easy to follow.

This method helps me learn 3× faster while still understanding deeply.
