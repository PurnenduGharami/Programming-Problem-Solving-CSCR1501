**Unit 1: Introduction to Problem Solving**.

This initial unit is entirely theoretical and foundational. Its goal is to teach you how to think in a structured way to solve problems *before* you start writing code.

The unit is broken down into three main sections:

### A) Flowchart
This is the visual component of problem-solving.
*   **Elements:** Understanding the basic symbols (Terminator, Process, Input/Output, Decision, Flow Lines).
*   **Concepts:**
    *   Identifying and understanding **input** and **output** operations.
    *   Representing **branching** (decisions) using the diamond symbol.
    *   Showing **iteration** (loops) by directing flow lines back to a previous step.

### B) Introduction to Algorithms for Problem Solving
This section focuses on the step-by-step logical plan.
*   Defining what an algorithm is.
*   Understanding the properties of a good algorithm (finiteness, definiteness, input, output, effectiveness).
*   Learning to write simple algorithms for various problems.

### C) Pseudo-code
This is the bridge between human-language algorithms and computer code.
*   **Representation:** Understanding how to represent different programming constructs (like `IF-THEN-ELSE`, `WHILE` loops) in a simplified, language-agnostic format.
*   **Practice:** Writing pseudo-code based on previously developed algorithms and flowcharts.
