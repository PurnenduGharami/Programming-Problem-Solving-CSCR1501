### Unit 1 - Introduction to Problem Solving

#### Category 1: Purpose and Practical Application

1.  Why should a programmer bother writing an algorithm before starting to code? What specific problems does it help prevent?
2.  Imagine you need to explain a program's logic to a non-technical project manager. Would you use pseudo-code or a flowchart? Justify your choice.
3.  What is the main goal of using pseudo-code in the programming process?
4.  How does the "Top-Down Design" approach help in managing the complexity of a large software project?
5.  Explain why "definiteness" is a critical property for an algorithm. What happens in a program if a step is ambiguous?

#### Category 2: Comparing Concepts

6.  What is the fundamental difference between an algorithm and a program?
7.  Compare a flowchart and pseudo-code. What are the main advantages of one over the other?
8.  Explain the difference between the "Problem Solving Phase" and the "Implementation Phase" in programming.
9.  Contrast the Top-Down and Bottom-Up approaches. Which is more aligned with the C programming language, and why?
10. How is a "sub-algorithm" different from the main algorithm? How does this relate to the concept of functions in C?

#### Category 3: Scenario-Based Problem Solving

11. I want to write a program that takes a number as input and prints "Even" or "Odd". Verbally, walk me through the algorithm.
12. For the Even/Odd problem, describe the flowchart. What specific symbols would you use and in what sequence?
13. Your task is to calculate the final price of an item after adding a 10% tax. What are the necessary inputs, processes, and outputs for this algorithm?
14. A program needs to read the marks of 50 students and count how many have passed (scored >= 50). Which of the three main control structures (Sequence, Decision, Repetition) would be the most important for this algorithm, and why?
15. Think about the "broken lamp" example. Why was the first version of the algorithm considered flawed, even though it seemed to cover all the steps? What does this teach you about algorithm design?

#### Category 4: Properties and Structures

16. An algorithm must be "finite." What common programming error does this property help a programmer avoid?
17. In a flowchart, what is the purpose of the diamond symbol, and why is it unique in terms of its flow lines compared to other symbols?
18. Can an algorithm have zero inputs? If yes, provide a practical example of such an algorithm.
19. Explain "stepwise refinement" using the "making coffee" example. How does this process help in developing a detailed and correct algorithm?
20. What is the role of an "On-Page Connector" in a flowchart, and when would you use it?

#### Category 5: Bridging Theory to Future Practice

21. How does understanding flowcharts help you visualize the flow of control in a C program, especially with `if-else` statements and `for` loops?
22. Pseudo-code uses keywords like `IF-THEN-ELSE`. How do you think this will translate into C syntax?
23. The "Top-Down" approach involves breaking a problem into smaller pieces. In C, what programming feature allows you to implement these smaller pieces?
24. When you design an algorithm, you define clear steps. How does this discipline help in debugging a program later on?
25. After completing this unit, what do you believe is the single most important lesson a programmer should take away from it before writing their first line of code?
